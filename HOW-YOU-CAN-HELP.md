Public Access UNIX (and GNU/Linux) History Documentation Project

HOW YOU CAN HELP

This information about the history of public access Unix systems 
(pubnixes) is maintained in a git repo.  This means that you can 
clone the repo, add or improve content, and submit a pull 
request to get it back into the main repo.  This relies on the 
same collaborative spirit found in modern pubbnixes.

You can help by improving the information or supporting tools 
and documentation any way you know how.  Specifically, some
ways to help include:

* Write software to help browse, analyze, or validate the data:

* Help extract information from existing documents:
The 'nixpub_lists' directory contains historical records of early 
public access Unix systems. There is a lot of information to be 
gleaned from these and transferred to the individual system 
records in the 'systems' directory.

* Add information you know about any of the historical systems.  
Were you a user? Were you a sysadmin? Or have you found 
references to these systems with more information?
