# pubnixhist
Public Access UNIX (and GNU/Linux) History Documentation Project

BACKGROUND

This project is a collaborative effort to document the servers 
that have made up the history of public access UNIX (and 
GNU/Linux) systems.  For brevity purposes, these will be called 
"pubnixes" here. This includes the modern tilde servers, like 
tilde.club and others inspired by it.

The main goal of this repository is to collect records and 
information on as many historical (or current) pubnixes as 
possible.  You may help by better organizing the information 
collected here, or by adding more information.

This collection of records is the merger of two lists collected by 
cmccabe and gauntlet (see CONTACT below) while independently 
writing papers on the history of pubnix systems.  We are guessing 
that others in the community know even more, so this repository is 
a public request for help from those of you who know bits of the 
history.


HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE: 

If you know of systems that aren't yet here, please add them!  And 
if you have more information about systems listed here, please add 
it!  More information can include annecdotes about how the system 
was used, about unique software on the system, or about community 
culture on the system.
