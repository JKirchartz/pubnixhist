# pubnixhist
Public Access UNIX (and GNU/Linux) History Documentation Project

BACKGROUND

This project is a collaborative effort to document the servers 
that have made up the history of public access UNIX (and 
GNU/Linux) systems.  For brevity purposes, these will be called 
"pubnixes" here. This includes the modern tilde servers, like 
tilde.club and others inspired by it.

The main goal of this repository is to collect records and 
information on as many historical (or current) pubnixes as 
possible.  You may help by better organizing the information 
collected here, or by adding more information.

This collection of records is the merger of two lists collected by 
cmccabe and gauntlet (see CONTACT below) while independently 
writing papers on the history of pubnix systems.  We are guessing 
that others in the community know even more, so this repository is 
a public request for help from those of you who know bits of the 
history.


REPO STRUCTURE

This repo was established with the assumption that people would 
be exploring and contributing to it via the command line.  It 
would be great if someone wanted to develop a gopher or www 
front-end for it though.  The following describes the directory 
stucture of the repo:

nixpub_lists - These are old files that were shared on USENET in 
the 1980's and 1990's with information about public access Unix 
systems.  Thank you to Phil Eschallier for so much work on 
these, and for helping me (cmccabe) to understand some of the 
surrounding history.

paper - This is a paper cmccabe wrote about the history of 
public access unix systems.  it is open for contributions.  you 
may also add your own papers to this directory if you've written 
other topics on this history.

scripts - A directory for scripts that may be used to browse, 
analyze or otherwise interact with the data in this repo.

systems - A file-based list of public access unix systems. This 
is the main goal of the repo -- trying to collect information on 
as many historical pubnixes as possible.  Most crowdsourced 
contributions to this repo will occur here.


HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE: 

If you know of systems that aren't yet here, please add them!  And 
if you have more information about systems listed here, please add 
it!  More information can include annecdotes about how the system 
was used, about unique software on the system, or about community 
culture on the system.

Look at the HOW-YOU-CAN-HELP.md file for more information on how 
you can contribute.
